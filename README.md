# Interview - Code review test

Ownable.sol contains a contract to manage the ownership of smart contracts with locking mechanisms. 
Next to the basic ownership functionality, it allows the owner to lock the contract functions only accessible to the owner for a certain amount of time.

Is this code trustable or could the deployer potentially pull the rug on the users?
